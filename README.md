# Halbton
My Playground to testdrive Angular.js.

Halbton should provide a simple computing of a tonevalue given a basetone and an offset.

This app is based on the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/)

I switched the backend from the shipped webserver to express, to define routes more easily.
Start the app by `node server.js`

`grunt` lints and tests the app.
Added command line arg `--runInTravis`to the grunt script to customize the build for the travis environment.

You can see it in action [here](http://halbton.herokuapp.com)
