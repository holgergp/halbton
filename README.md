# Halbton
My Playground to testdrive Angular.js.

Halbton should provide a simple computing of a tonevalue given a basetone and an offset.

This app is based on the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/)

I switched the backend from the shipped webserver with express, to define routes more easily.
Start the app by `node app.js`
